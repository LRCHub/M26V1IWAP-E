There once was a ship that put
to sea
The name of the ship was
the Billy of Tea
The winds blew up, her bow
dipped down
O blow, my bully boys, blow
(Huh!)
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and
rum
One day, when the tonguin’ is
done
We’ll take our leave and go
She’d not been two weeks from
shore
When down on her, a right whale
bore
The captain called all hands and
swore
He’d take that whale in tow
(Huh!)
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tеa and
rum
One day, when the tonguin’ is
donе
We’ll take our leave and go
Da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Before the boat had hit the
water
The whale’s tail came up and
caught her
All hands to the side, harpooned
and fought her
When she dived down low (Huh!)
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and
rum
One day, when the tonguin’ is
done
We’ll take our leave and go
No line was cut, no whale was
freed
The Captain’s mind was not of
greed
But he belonged to the
whaleman’s creed
She took that ship in tow (Huh!)
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and
rum
One day, when the tonguin’ is
done
We’ll take our leave and go
Da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
For forty days, or even more
The line went slack, then tight
once more
All boats were lost, there were
only four
But still that whale did go
(Huh!)
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and
rum
One day, when the tonguin’ is
done
We’ll take our leave and go
As far as I’ve heard, the
fight’s still on
The line’s not cut and the
whale’s not gone
The Wellerman makes his regular
call
To encourage the Captain, crew,
and all (Huh!)
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and
rum
One day, when the tonguin’ is
done
We’ll take our leave and go
Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and
rum
One day, when the tonguin’ is
done
We’ll take our leave and go
