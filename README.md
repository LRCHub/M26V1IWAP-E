```lrc
[00:02.56] There once was a ship that put to sea
[00:05.25] The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea
[00:07.83] The winds blew up, her bow dipped down
[00:10.19] O blow, my bully boys, blow (huh)
[00:26.69] 
[00:12.84] Soon may the Wellerman come
[00:15.29] To bring us sugar and tea and rum
[00:17.72] One day, when the tonguin' is done
[00:20.14] We'll take our leave and go
[00:33.64] 
[00:22.78] She had not been two weeks from shore
[00:25.25] When down on her, a right whale bore
[00:27.83] The captain called all hands and swore
[00:30.33] He'd take that whale in tow (huh)
[00:46.83] 
[00:32.78] Soon may the Wellerman come
[00:35.35] To bring us sugar and tea and rum
[00:37.75] One day, when the tonguin' is done
[00:40.28] We'll take our leave and go
[00:53.78] 
[00:43.22] Da-da, da-da-da-da
[00:46.11] Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
[00:48.41] Da-da, da-da-da-da
[00:50.54] Da-da-da-da-da-da
[00:59.04] 
[00:52.76] Before the boat had hit the water
[00:55.22] The whale's tail came up and caught her
[00:57.82] All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
[01:00.43] When she dived down low (huh)
[01:14.93] 
[01:02.71] Soon may the Wellerman come
[01:05.27] To bring us sugar and tea and rum
[01:07.83] One day, when the tonguin' is done
[01:10.03] We'll take our leave and go
[01:23.53] 
[01:12.93] No line was cut, no whale was freed
[01:15.18] The captain's mind was not on greed
[01:17.75] And he belonged to the whaleman's creed
[01:20.09] She took the ship in tow (huh)
[01:35.09] 
[01:22.84] Soon may the Wellerman come
[01:25.29] To bring us sugar and tea and rum
[01:27.77] One day, when the tonguin' is done
[01:30.08] We'll take our leave and go
[01:43.58] 
[01:32.78] Da-da, da-da-da-da
[01:35.10] Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
[01:37.83] Da-da, da-da-da-da
[01:40.27] Da-da-da-da-da-da
[01:48.77] 
[01:42.76] For 40 days, or even more
[01:45.26] The line went slack, then tight once more
[01:47.91] All boats were lost, there were only four
[01:50.24] But still that whale did go (huh)
[02:06.74] 
[01:52.72] Soon may the Wellerman come
[01:55.47] To bring us sugar and tea and rum
[01:57.71] One day, when the tonguin' is done
[02:00.05] We'll take our leave and go
[02:13.55] 
[02:02.78] As far as I've heard, the fight's still on
[02:05.33] The line's not cut and the whale's not gone
[02:07.89] The Wellerman makes his regular call
[02:10.25] To encourage the captain, crew, and all (huh)
[02:32.75] 
[02:12.86] Soon may the Wellerman come
[02:15.11] To bring us sugar and tea and rum
[02:17.69] One day, when the tonguin' is done
[02:20.07] We'll take our leave and go
[02:33.57] 
[02:22.89] Soon may the Wellerman come
[02:25.42] To bring us sugar and tea and rum
[02:28.00] One day, when the tonguin' is done
[02:30.12] We'll take our leave and go
